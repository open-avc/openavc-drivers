# GENERATED FILE - DO NOT EDIT.
# Vendored from the OpenAVC platform repo (github.com/open-avc/openavc),
# source: server/drivers/avcdriver_semantic.py

"""Driver-definition validation rules (the .avcdriver contract).

Every cross-field rule that decides whether a driver definition is valid
lives in this one module. The runtime loader wraps it (adding the
discovery-block check, which needs the discovery engine's parser), and
the community driver catalog runs a copy of the same rules in its CI —
so a definition that passes catalog review is exactly a definition the
platform will load.

Purity contract: standard library plus the sibling ``spec`` constants
table and the stdlib-only regex-safety helper. Nothing here may import
the server runtime, transports, or discovery machinery; checks that need
them are passed in (see ``validate_driver_definition``'s
``discovery_validator`` hook). An import-guard test enforces this.

    The validation walk below enters one section of a definition at a time and
    every one of its ~200 rules appends to the same ``errors`` list. So the
    walk stamps its current location on the list itself — ``errors.ctx =
    "commands.power_on"`` — instead of every rule site growing a path
    argument. A rule that fires deep inside a helper inherits the enclosing
    section's tag for free, because the helper appends to this same object.

    Two properties make this safe to drop into the existing walk:

    * It **is** a list, so ``validate_driver_definition`` keeps its
      ``list[str]`` contract and no existing caller changes — the loader, the
      save routes, ``build_index.py`` and the vendored catalog copy all see
      exactly what they saw before.
    * ``list.extend`` does not route through a subclass's ``append``, so both
