"""Child local-id coercion — the one place that reads ``id_format.type``.

A child entity's id arrives from the outside world untyped: a URL path
component, a command parameter, a regex capture off the wire. Every one of
those has to become the kind the driver declared in
``child_entity_types.<type>.id_format`` before it can be looked up, and the
rule is identical wherever it happens:

  * ``integer`` (the default when undeclared) — parse to ``int``. A bool is
    refused outright, because ``int(True)`` is 1 and would silently land on
    child 1.
  * ``string`` — the text, stripped. Valid string ids are restricted to
    ``[A-Za-z0-9_-]`` (see ``BaseDriver._format_child_id``), so surrounding
    whitespace is never part of a real id and stripping it can only help.

Coercion says nothing about whether the id *exists* — that belongs to the
driver's child registry, and ``_format_child_id`` is the validating inverse of
this (a typed id back to its padded string form). It does now answer whether
an id is in the declared RANGE: see ``child_id_range_error``, and which ids the
type declares at all: see ``declared_child_ids``.

Callers own the failure. Every function here returns ``None`` rather than
raising, because the same bad input is a 404 to a REST route, a rejected
parameter to the command dispatcher, and a skipped roster entry to a driver
building its children. Pure stdlib, no server imports, so the simulator can
share it too.

    The declared roster, never the live one. A page is usually authored against

    the install — and an unconnected device has no children at all. Believing an
    empty live roster is how a 4x4 on the bench offers a convincing sixteen

    ``None`` whenever the declaration cannot settle it, which is a real answer
    and the common one:

    * ``count_from_state`` — the device resizes the roster once it answers, so
      anything said here is a prediction rather than a fact.
    * ``count_from`` / ``ids_from`` naming a config field this device has not
      filled in. The FIELD is what the caller should name in that case; it is
      right there in ``instances``.
    * no ``instances`` block at all, which is every Python driver that registers
      its children in code.

    Values come back as the declaration spells them — ``1..N`` as integers for a
    count, the literal entries for ``ids``, the split parts for ``ids_from``.
    Coercing them to the type's id kind is the caller's job (``ids`` on a

    """What a child is CALLED — the one place that settles the precedence.

    A child entity can get its name from three independent places, and they
    are not interchangeable:

      * the **project label**, typed by the integrator and stored in the
        project file,
      * the **device-reported name**, live in the child's own state under the
        state variable the type names in ``label_field`` (a MENTOR endpoint
        name, a DSP component's name, a light's name on its controller), and
      * the **roster label**, seeded from an ``instances.label`` template
        ("Extension {id}") into the child's own reserved ``label`` key — what
        the driver author calls the slot when nobody else has named it.

    The order is: the integrator's own words win, then whatever the device
    calls itself, then what the driver's roster calls the position, then
    nothing. Returning ``""`` for "nothing" is deliberate — the caller owns the
    fallback, because the useful fallback differs by surface (a param picker
    wants ``"decoder 3"``, a matrix picker wants ``"Decoder 3"``, and a report
    may want to say nothing at all). This function answers *what it is called*,
    never *how to word its absence*.

    It lives here, with the other child rules, because more than one door asks
    it and the answers must agree: the child-entity REST responses (which is
    what every param picker in the IDE renders) and the matrix-proposal picker.
    They disagreed until 2026-08-16 — the matrix picker read only the project
    label, so a device-enumerated roster whose names live on the device offered
    "Encoder 1 / Encoder 2" while the param picker beside it showed the real
    endpoint names. Retyping names the device already knows is precisely what
    matrix inference exists to prevent.

    The roster label was the same omission one step further down: a mixer's
    seven AT-LINK extension slots seed "Extension 1".."Extension 7" and report
    no device name until something is chained to them, so every row read
    "(no label)" while the driver had named all seven.
