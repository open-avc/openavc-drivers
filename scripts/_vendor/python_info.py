"""Reading a Python driver's ``DRIVER_INFO`` without importing it.

A ``.py`` driver's contract lives in a ``DRIVER_INFO`` dict on its class. Every
door that wants to check that contract before the driver runs — the standalone
checker, ``simulator.validate``, the community catalog's CI — has to read it
from the source text, because importing a driver executes arbitrary code and
needs its dependencies present.

This module is that reader, plus the structural rules that can be decided from
the dict alone. It exists so there is exactly one of each: the catalog's
``build_index.py`` used to carry its own copy of the AST walk, and the runtime
loader its own copy of the structural rules.

Purity contract, same as ``spec`` and ``avcdriver_semantic``: standard library
only. The community catalog vendors this file and runs it in a CI job that
installs no ``openavc`` package. An import-guard test enforces it.
