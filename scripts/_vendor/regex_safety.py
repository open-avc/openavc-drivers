"""
Shared regex-safety validation.

Rejects invalid or catastrophic-backtracking (ReDoS) patterns before they run
against attacker-influenced input on a synchronous path. Two callers share this
check:

    - the driver loader, where ``responses[]`` and ``auth:`` patterns are
      matched against raw pre-auth device bytes, and
    - the cloud alert monitor, where the ``matches`` operator runs a
      cloud-pushed pattern on every state change, inline on the event loop.

A ReDoS pattern in either place blocks its thread/loop, so both validate
patterns up front with the same detector. Structural detection is the primary
check; a short, time-boxed empirical probe is a secondary backstop for shapes
the structural rules don't model.
