# Vendored from the OpenAVC platform repo (github.com/open-avc/openavc),

"""Single source of the .avcdriver driver-contract constants.

The driver contract — which fields exist, which values they accept, which
capabilities belong to YAML drivers vs. Python drivers — is consumed in
several places: the definition validator (``avcdriver_semantic``), the
runtime loader, the actions runtime, the community catalog's validator,
the published JSON Schema, and the Driver Builder's types. Each constant
here is THE definition; everything else derives from or imports it, so
the surfaces can't disagree about what the contract says.

Purity contract: standard library only. This module is imported by the
simulator, by validation code that runs outside the server (the community
driver catalog vendors it), and by transports — it must never pull in the
runtime, and it must stay import-cycle-free (nothing in server/ is above
it).
