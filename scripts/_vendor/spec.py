# GENERATED FILE - DO NOT EDIT.
# Vendored from the OpenAVC platform repo (github.com/open-avc/openavc),
# source: server/drivers/spec.py
# The platform copy is the source of truth for the driver contract; CI
# fails when this copy drifts from it. To update, run:
#     python scripts/vendor_platform_contract.py

"""Single source of the .avcdriver driver-contract constants.

The driver contract — which fields exist, which values they accept, which
capabilities belong to YAML drivers vs. Python drivers — is consumed in
several places: the definition validator (``avcdriver_semantic``), the
runtime loader, the actions runtime, the community catalog's validator,
the published JSON Schema, and the Driver Builder's types. Each constant
here is THE definition; everything else derives from or imports it, so
the surfaces can't disagree about what the contract says.

Purity contract: standard library only. This module is imported by the
simulator, by validation code that runs outside the server (the community
driver catalog vendors it), and by transports — it must never pull in the
runtime, and it must stay import-cycle-free (nothing in server/ is above
it).

# --- top-level contract ------------------------------------------------------

# Required top-level fields in a driver definition. Ordered (not a set) so
# missing-field errors always report in the same order run to run.
REQUIRED_FIELDS: tuple[str, ...] = ("id", "name", "transport")

# Transports a YAML (.avcdriver) definition may declare. "bridge" is the
# sentinel for a device that emits through a live bridge instance (an IR
# device on an emitter port) rather than dialing a host of its own.
YAML_TRANSPORTS: tuple[str, ...] = ("tcp", "serial", "udp", "http", "osc", "bridge")

# Transports only a Python driver can use — they need driver code (message
# routing hooks, session handling) that the declarative runtime doesn't model.
PYTHON_ONLY_TRANSPORTS: tuple[str, ...] = ("ssh", "mqtt")

# Driver ids with these prefixes are authoring templates (the built-in
# generic devices). They are exempt from discovery validation — templates
# don't participate in device matching.
GENERIC_ID_PREFIXES: tuple[str, ...] = ("generic_",)

# Value types for state variables, child state variables, and device settings.
VALUE_TYPES: tuple[str, ...] = ("string", "integer", "number", "boolean", "enum", "float")

# Blocks whose keys become config fields a template/reference may name.
CONFIG_FIELD_SOURCES: tuple[str, ...] = ("config_schema", "default_config", "config_derived")

# --- transports with extra constraints ---------------------------------------

# Transports the auth: login-handshake block supports (it swaps the frame
# parser and types credentials over a raw byte stream).
AUTH_TRANSPORTS: tuple[str, ...] = ("tcp", "serial")

# Auth handshake types the runtime implements.
AUTH_TYPES: tuple[str, ...] = ("telnet_login",)

# Transports the liveness: watchdog supports (the socket transports that can
# die silently; HTTP polling already awaits every response, bridge devices
# own no transport).
LIVENESS_TRANSPORTS: tuple[str, ...] = ("tcp", "serial", "udp", "osc")

# --- framing -----------------------------------------------------------------

# Receive-side frame_parser types a YAML driver may declare, and the

STRUCT_LENGTH_SIZES: tuple[int, ...] = (1, 2, 4)

# --- push --------------------------------------------------------------------

# Push subscription types and the keys each accepts. Every type needs its
# own channel machinery in the runtime, so an unknown type is an error, and
# unknown keys are rejected against this table.

# --- OSC ---------------------------------------------------------------------

# OSC argument type tags the ConfigurableDriver runtime can encode from a YAML
# value. 'b' (blob/bytes) is intentionally excluded — there's no unambiguous way
# to express raw bytes in a YAML arg value, so it isn't a declarative type (the
# Driver Builder UI and avcdriver.schema.json omit it too). An unsupported tag
# is dropped silently at send time, yielding a malformed OSC message — catch it
# at load instead.

# --- command params ----------------------------------------------------------

# Sources a param's option list can cascade from (`options_from.source`).
PARAM_OPTIONS_FROM_SOURCES: frozenset[str] = frozenset({"child_schema"})

# --- actions -----------------------------------------------------------------

# Action kinds the platform understands. "command" promotes an existing command
# (runs online through send_command); "setup" is the offline-capable
# provisioning wizard handled by the driver's run_setup_action(); "link" opens a
# URL (the device's web UI) in a new tab, purely client-side.
ACTION_KINDS: tuple[str, ...] = ("command", "setup", "link")

# Action kinds only a Python driver can declare: "setup" needs a
# run_setup_action handler, which the declarative runtime doesn't have.

# How an action's visibility tracks the device's connection state.
AVAILABILITIES: tuple[str, ...] = ("online", "offline", "always")

# Operators accepted in a visible_when condition. Mirrors the shared condition
# evaluator (server/core/condition_eval.py) and the panel / Stream Deck (§38)
# JS evaluator so an action condition behaves identically everywhere.
